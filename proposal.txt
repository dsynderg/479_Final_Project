I want to test the validity of a photo to translation pipeline
what is the validity of zero shot prompting in photo to translation
I will be using zeroshot prompting between spanish and portuguese.
The goal is to attain a bleu score of 33 between the two languages
and a comet score of 60.
I want to achive this by creating omin directional tags using english spanish
and english portuguese pairs.
